# Defender's Quest Unofficial Mod Editor
A tool to assist in creating mods for the game [Defender's Quest](http://www.defendersquest.com/1/).

## Downloading
In order to run the editor, you will need:
* For Windows: [.NET Framework version 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) from Microsoft. This may well be already installed on your computer.
* For other operating systems: A sufficiently recent version of [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) should work. The editor hasn't yet been tested on non-windows systems, so if you try this you are a brave and attractive person and your house might catch fire and you should email me to let me know whether it worked and whether your house did in fact catch fire.

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/Autoquark/dq1-unofficial-mod-editor/releases/latest). Just unzip all the files into a directory somewhere and run GUI.exe.

## Current Features
* Edit basic mod info (title, description etc.)
* Edit (but not add or remove) some parts of enemy type definitions.

Note that this tool is in an alpha state. There may be bugs - backup your mod before opening.

## Plans
The eventual goal of this project is to support editing all of the information contained within a mod. Once the official modding documentation for the recently released Deluxe Edition of Defender's Quest is released, I will probably be able to plan at least a little bit in advance. Right now I am implementing whatever I'm confident I can work out from examining the files.
